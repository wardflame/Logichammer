Logichammer: Scripture

Mod intends to provide players faction names that will develop in accordance with their Legendary Lord, culture, and campaign progression.

For instance, Kostaltyn of Kislev is leader of the Cult of Ursun and unofficial leader of the Great Orthodoxy. Could he have a mod-made questline
which leads to him becoming the official Great Orthodoxy leader? Perhaps Kostaltyn needs to weave Kislevite politics to succeed Tsar power with
religious power, or use religious power to increase Tsar power.
